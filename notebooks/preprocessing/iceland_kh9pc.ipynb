    "The first step of the preprocessing pipeline is to **join multiple image tiles** into a single, continuous image. This process is necessary because **KH9 PC images are typically split into 10-12 separate parts**, each approximately **1 GB in size**, due to their large original resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **joining these image parts is not straightforward**, primarily because there is a **slight overlap between adjacent tiles**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately reconstruct the full image, we need to perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detect keypoints (interest points)** along the **right border** of the first image part.\n",
    "2. Detect corresponding keypoints along the **left border** of the next image part.\n",
    "3. **Match these keypoints** using a feature-matching algorithm to find candidate correspondences.\n",
    "4. Use **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)** to filter out mismatched or erroneous correspondences (i.e., outliers).\n",
    "5. Estimate a **relative geometric transformation** (typically a translation or affine transform) to correctly align the second image with the first.\n",
    "6. Apply this transformation and **merge the two parts** into a larger composite image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated sequentially for all image parts, progressively building up the full image mosaic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform that 2 functions exists:\n",
    "- `join_images_asp` (recommanded) : which will use [`image_mosaic`](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/image_mosaic.html) program from Ames Stereo Pipeline. This function is much more safer but it requiered to install ASP and the command need to be visible in your path.\n",
